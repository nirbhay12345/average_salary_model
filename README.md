# Average Salary Dataset Analysis README

## Overview
This dataset contains information about individuals, including demographic attributes such as age, education, occupation, etc., as well as whether their income exceeds $50K per year. The dataset is useful for various types of analyses, including demographic studies, income prediction modeling, and exploratory data analysis.

## Dataset Information
- **Format**: CSV (Comma Separated Values)
- **Columns**:
    1. age: Age of the individual.
    2. workclass: Type of employer the individual works for.
    3. fnlwgt: Final weight used in sampling.
    4. education: Highest level of education achieved.
    5. educational-num: Numerical representation of education.
    6. marital-status: Marital status of the individual.
    7. occupation: Type of occupation.
    8. relationship: Relationship status.
    9. race: Race of the individual.
    10. gender: Gender of the individual.
    11. capital-gain: Capital gains of the individual.
    12. capital-loss: Capital losses of the individual.
    13. hours-per-week: Number of hours worked per week.
    14. native-country: Country of origin.
    15. income_>50K: Binary indicator of whether the individual's income exceeds $50K per year.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and frequency distributions for categorical columns.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. Handle them appropriately.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore relationships between different variables using visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots, scatter plots).
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary, derive insights from existing features.
5. **Income Prediction Modeling**: Build predictive models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on available attributes. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
6. **Feature Importance**: Determine which features have the most significant impact on predicting income levels.
7. **Ethnicity and Gender Analysis**: Explore any disparities in income levels based on ethnicity and gender.
